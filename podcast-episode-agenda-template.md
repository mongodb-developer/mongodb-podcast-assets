# Podcast Agenda Template

This is an interview-style podcast agenda script. 

## Episode Title

Provide a title for the podcast. Think SEO when you're creating this.

### Hosts
* Mike Lynn
* Nic Raboy

### Guest(s)

* John Smith <john.smith@email.com> Twitter: @johnsmith
* Jane Doe <jane.doe@email.com> Twitter: @janedoe

### Goals

Clearly state the goal(s) of the episode.

E.g. 

* Raise Awareness of technology XYZ

### Guest BIO

#### Who is Jane Doe?

Fill this out with as many details about your guest as possible. Who are they, what have they done, what are their major accomplishments? Do this for each guest appearing.

### Discussion Agenda

Fill this section out with a bulletted list of questions and topics you'd like to discuss with the guest. I find it helpful to phrase each question in the same way you would ask the guest.

* Jane, how long have you been developing software?
* Tell the audience a bit more about your product, service, project, etc.
* How did that come about?
* When did your realize this would be your passion?
* Tell me about your interactions with John. How did you meet? When did you start working on this project?
* Who is your audience, customer?
* What do you want people do know about this project that people might not know?
* What's next? Can you talk about your roadmap?

This is obviously just a few template questions. You'll need to fill these out specifically for each of your guests.

### Closing

* Contact details for the guest. How can listeners contact you? Where can listeners find you on social media?
* Plugs. Give the guest an opportunity to talk about their product, project or anything they want to plug. When they succeed, you succeed.

### Intro

Odd that this comes last - but that's intentional. You will not likely write the introduction to this episode until after it's been recorded. Keep this section in your agenda and remember to update the document with the intro notes you intend to use. Make the intro short. Pull key items from the interview and mention those. Give the listener a crystal clear idea about what to expect in the first 30 seconds of the recording.
